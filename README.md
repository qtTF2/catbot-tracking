# Public page for cat-bots
I saw botpolice.eu's public page for their cat-bots but it was mostly data being hardcoded. This repo is created to let the everyone see what server is your bots are playing and what or how they are doing.

Please make sure to edit `index.html` and `scripts/pub.js`.

# Quick Install
If u have catbot-setup installed just go to `/home/$USER/Desktop/catbot-setup/cathook-ipc-web-panel/public` and make sure to copy the admin panel otherwise u will lose access to control ur bots.

Copy everything u see in the public folder into its folder **before planning to copy the files from this repo** and call it /admin. Beware bcuz people will able to access the admin panel but they will unable to use any admin commands as it will require them authentication.
